# Textify
Hi! This is just a personal project to convert visual media into ASCII art, written in both C, C++, and Go! <br>
I have revisited this project many times, switching languages very often when one language's downfall annoys me. C's obscurity and complexity. C++'s horrible error messages. Go's lack of (simple to implement) GUI frameworks and lesser performance. But, it's good practice for me!

## Current Features (by language)
### Go
- Image conversion
- Sequence conversion & playback
### C
- Image conversion
- broken lol
### C++
- Image conversion
- Sequence conversion & playback
- also broken lol

## Future Update Goals:
- Terminal Color (option)
- Linux support

I would like to add more, of course, but I tend to be a little to ambitious with my projects. Even these are a little steep, so I guess we'll have to see how much gets done!

### Extra Notes
*Unfortunately, this will most likely not be done as expected. Instead, it will be done using a sequence of images in a folder. Video encoding is too difficult, and there is really no solution around it, without then adding either too many libraries, too many errors, or too many limitations.
