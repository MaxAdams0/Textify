# Textify
Hi! This is just a personal project to convert image (and eventually videos) into ASCII art, wriiten in C! <br>
This project is something I come back to every once and a while, originally having written it in C++ but deciding that it is not the right language for me. Also, my old rusty code needed to be revitalized with new knowledge, so I decided to start over completely in C!

## Future Update Goals:
- Video conversion/placyback
- Terminal Color (option)
- Linux support
I would like to add more, of course, but I tend to be a little to ambitious with my projects. Even these are a little steep, so I guess we'll have to see how much gets done!
